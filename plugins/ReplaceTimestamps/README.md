## Installation
1. Download the 'ReplaceTimestamps.pluging.js' file
2. Add it to your Better Discord plugins folder

## Configuration
By default, you can wrap timestamps in `!!` to convert them to discords timestamp format. But, this can easily be changed to use any other character by changing the preset regex with your own.
