## Installation
1. Download the 'VirusScanner.pluging.js' file
2. Add it to your Better Discord plugins folder

## Usage
### Scanning a file
To scan a file, right-click on the file link and click on the `Scan URL` option. The results will be displayed next to the file name. 

<span style="color: red">**Note:**</span> This also works for regular links to websites.

### Full report
Optionally, if you are extra paranoid, you can generate a full report for files or links. To do this, just toggle the switch in the plugin settings. A full report will be generated for every file you scan. It will tell you what the file is, what it does, and if it is malicious or not.

### Getting a Hybrid Analysis API key
To use this plugin, you need to get a Hybrid Analysis API key. You can get one [here](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/my-account?tab=%23api-key-tab). Once you have your API key, you can add it to the plugin settings.
